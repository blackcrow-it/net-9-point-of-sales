## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What is the required data retention period for completed orders and customer transaction history? → A: 7+ years (regulatory compliance)
- Q: What level of system monitoring and alerting is required for production operations? → A: Basic uptime monitoring only (ping/health checks)
- Q: What is the expected initial deployment scale for this POS system? → A: Medium chain (6-20 stores, 50-100 employees)
- Q: Do loyalty points have an expiration policy? → A: Configurable per customer group
- Q: How should the system behave during extended third-party service outages (>1 hour)? → A: Queue operations for automatic retry when service returns

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories

#### Story 1: Sales Transaction Processing
**As a** Sales Staff member
**I want to** process customer purchases quickly and accurately
**So that** customers have a smooth checkout experience and inventory is properly tracked

#### Story 2: Inventory Management
**As a** Warehouse Staff member
**I want to** manage product stock levels, receive shipments, and track inventory movements
**So that** the store always has accurate stock information and can avoid stockouts

#### Story 3: Customer Relationship Management
**As a** Store Manager
**I want to** track customer information, purchase history, and loyalty points
**So that** I can provide personalized service and retain valuable customers

#### Story 4: Business Analytics
**As a** Store Owner
**I want to** view comprehensive sales, inventory, and financial reports
**So that** I can make data-driven business decisions

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### POS Module
1. **Given** a cashier is logged into their shift with initial cash recorded, **When** they scan a product barcode, **Then** the product is added to the cart with correct price and inventory is checked
2. **Given** a customer wants to pay with multiple payment methods, **When** the cashier processes payment with cash and QR code, **Then** the system accepts both payments and calculates correct change
3. **Given** a completed sale, **When** the cashier requests a receipt, **Then** the system generates a formatted receipt for thermal printing
4. **Given** a customer wants to return a product, **When** the cashier processes the return with the original receipt, **Then** inventory is updated and refund is issued per policy

#### Inventory Module
5. **Given** new stock arrives from supplier, **When** warehouse staff creates a receiving document, **Then** inventory quantities increase and supplier debt is recorded
6. **Given** a product is running low, **When** stock level falls below minimum threshold, **Then** the system sends a low stock alert
7. **Given** it's time for inventory count, **When** staff performs stocktake, **Then** system compares physical vs system counts and generates adjustment documents
8. **Given** a product has variants (color, size), **When** managing inventory, **Then** each variant is tracked separately with unique SKU

#### CRM Module
9. **Given** a new customer makes a purchase, **When** staff collects customer information, **Then** customer profile is created with contact details and purchase history
10. **Given** a loyal customer completes a purchase, **When** transaction is finalized, **Then** loyalty points are automatically calculated and added to customer account
11. **Given** a customer has outstanding debt, **When** they make a payment, **Then** debt balance is updated and payment is recorded

#### Employee Module
12. **Given** a new employee joins, **When** manager creates their account with assigned role, **Then** employee can log in with appropriate permissions
13. **Given** an employee completes sales, **When** commission period ends, **Then** system calculates commission based on configured rates

#### Reporting Module
14. **Given** a manager wants to review performance, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** key metrics (today's revenue, orders, low stock items) are displayed
15. **Given** owner needs financial analysis, **When** they generate sales report for date range, **Then** revenue, profit, and order statistics are calculated and displayed

### Edge Cases

#### POS Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to sell a product with zero or negative inventory?
  - System warns but allows sale if "allow negative inventory" is configured, otherwise blocks transaction
- What happens when a customer pays less than the total amount?
  - System displays outstanding balance and prevents completion until full amount is received
- What happens when processing a return for a product no longer in the system?
  - System allows return based on original receipt data but warns about product discontinuation

#### Inventory Edge Cases
- What happens when receiving products with expiry dates or batch numbers?
  - System tracks lot numbers and expiry dates separately, enables FEFO (First Expired First Out) reporting
- What happens when transferring stock between stores?
  - System creates issue document at source store and receipt document at destination store
- What happens during stocktake if large discrepancies are found?
  - System flags items with >10% variance for manager review before finalizing adjustment

#### CRM Edge Cases
- What happens when creating customer with duplicate phone number?
  - System warns about potential duplicate and offers to view existing customer or create anyway
- What happens when customer tries to redeem more loyalty points than they have?
  - System prevents redemption and displays available point balance

#### Multi-Store Edge Cases
- What happens when viewing reports across multiple stores?
  - System aggregates data across all stores with ability to drill down to individual store details
- What happens when employee transfers between stores?
  - Employee account remains active with updated store assignment and historical data preserved

#### Integration Edge Cases
- What happens when payment gateway (VNPAY) is unavailable?
  - System allows manual recording of payment with reference number for later reconciliation
- What happens when shipping provider API returns error?
  - System logs error, notifies user, and allows manual entry of tracking information
- What happens during extended third-party service outages (>1 hour)?
  - System queues failed operations and automatically retries when service becomes available

## Source Documents Reference

This specification was derived from three comprehensive source documents:
- **URD v1.0** (User Requirements Document) - defines user needs, actors, and functional requirements
- **SRS v1.0** (Software Requirements Specification) - details specific system behaviors and constraints
